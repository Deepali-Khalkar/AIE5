### Assignment

In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the AIE5 challenge (from [this repository](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/Beyond-ChatGPT)) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application. 

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!

> NOTE: This will require you to make updates to your personal class repository, instructions on that process can be found [here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE5/00_Setting Up Git/README.md)!

#### How AIM Does Assignments
Throughout our time together - we'll be providing a number of assignments. Each assignment can be split into two broad categories:

- Base Assignment - a more conceptual and theory based assignment focused on locking in specific key concepts and learnings.
- Hardmode Assignment - a more programming focused assignment focused on core code-concepts.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ❓Questions - these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!
- 🏗️ Activities - these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.
- 🚧 Advanced Builds - these will only appear in Hardmode assignments, and will require you to build something with little to no help outside of documentation!

##### 🏗️ Activity #1:

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner. 

![activity1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94f96035-43b2-495c-9653-3b6fda8f11ff)

    - Aspect Tested: Question/Answering and summarization

    
2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points…
    ![activity2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3c3eaf1-d597-4180-a47b-87915cb2c486)
    - Aspect Tested: Summarization
      
3. Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    ![activity3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6f36dc1-5b60-4de5-951a-cda44d6d77a8)

    - Aspect Tested: Text generation
      
4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    
    ![activity4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4990a74-15aa-421c-92f3-a1a8fa3462bf)

    - Aspect Tested: Reasoning. Question/Answering
  
      
5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone…

    ![activity5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0300e10-6705-4477-8f5f-32588c9ec92d)

    - Aspect Tested: Text Generation/Tone

This "vibe check" now serves as a baseline, of sorts, to help understand what holes your application has.

##### 🚧 Advanced Build:

Please make adjustments to your application that you believe will improve the vibe check done above, push the changes to your HF Space and redo the above vibe check.

I changed the the model from gpt-3.5-turbo to gpt-4o-mini and also change the prompt. I saw improvement in the response generated by the model as below
1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner. 

![activity1_new](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/929af9b3-9a93-4faf-8fea-1f89331f1e6f)

The responses are in bulleted points

2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points…
![activity2_new](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ec083af-a323-4156-a84c-4066d1cd7e2c)

3. Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.

![activity3_new](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f326b5a5-3f30-4d0c-8222-f4a9d8a76759)

I changed the prompt for this response. I removed the bulleting instructions from the prompt to get this response.


4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
![activity4_new](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/470e17f0-88e2-4c3b-a206-235f218316ca)
Model expains the reasoning in step by step


5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone…
![activity5_new](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e48d7e4-78e3-4a0e-9728-1387eea796dc)
I changed the prompt for this response. I removed the bulleting instructions from the prompt to get this response.

> NOTE: You may reach for improving the model, changing the prompt, or any other method.

### A Note on Vibe Checking

"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.

In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

##### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑❓ Discussion Question #1:

What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool?
